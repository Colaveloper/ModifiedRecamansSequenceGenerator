# ModifiedRecamansSequenceGenerator
 Recaman's sequence that takes care of negative numbers, generating an even more chaotic outcome!

RULES OF TRADITIONAL RECAMAN'S SEQUENCE:
- starts from 0
- the gap between two sequence numbers starts from 1 and increases steadly by adding 1
- sequence numbers can't repeat
- sequence numbers have to be the lowest as possible

RULES OF THIS VERSION OF THE SEQUENCE:
- starts from 0
- the gap(called jump) between two sequence numbers starts from 1 and increases if the previous number(called position) is positive, and vice versa
- sequence numbers can't repeat
- sequence numbers have to be the closest to 0 as possible

NOTES:
- both sequencies appear to be infinite, although not mathematically proven
- locally, my sequence is similar to Recaman's sequence
